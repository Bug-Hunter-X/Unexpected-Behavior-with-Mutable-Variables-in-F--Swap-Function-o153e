This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F# when working with mutable variables.  The `swap` function attempts to swap the values of `x` and `y`, but because mutable variables are passed by reference, the function modifies the original variables directly.  This results in both `x` and `y` having the same value after the swap operation.  The solution shows how to correctly swap values using a tuple to pass by value and avoid unexpected side effects.
